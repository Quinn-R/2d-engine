Make movement and all other interactions in a different class that will import all the object types. The sfml class is still a separate entity from this.

I think that the character objects should have an inventory to make the different from the collide objects.

Perhaps the inventory should be a different class so that it is easier for the items to be implemented. 

The reason all of the classes have to be connected like this is because I am planning on using a vector to store all objects. This requires every class that deals with this to be connected to the class that fills the vector.

The following diagram depicts what I think the include hierarchy should look like so that the interact class can understand and have access to all of the objects.
